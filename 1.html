                The COVID-19 pandemic is now a major threat to global health and economy, the full impact of which is yet unknown. The case load and deaths are gradually mounting in India too, especially over these past weeks. These figures may have been substantially higher if the Government of India had not put in such stringent, pre-emptive containment measures. There is also a clear variation in how different states are handling the crisis, and that difference shows in the numbers of new cases and deaths occurring.

But this pandemic cannot be controlled by governments alone. It needs the participation and passion of all the people of India; and it needs clear, feasible measures that ordinary citizens can undertake to help reduce transmission. The lockdown has probably played a great role in flattening the epidemic curve thus far, but it cannot go on forever. It remains an experimental intervention not just for India, but for other countries as well.

                In this COVID-19 a main reason in this increase of cases is the LACK OF MASKS AND SANITISATION MATERAIALS as thay are not available to everyone / all citizens .
